# This is a Yugioh Cards finder
This project is developed using Lit-element, as test skills.
The API provided is : [YugiohAPI](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php)

Because this project is building with lit-element you need to install polymer serve library to run this project:

```npm
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

then you can run the project using:
```npm
polymer serve
```

I'll try to implement a different way to run this project using webpack to set all the differents loader and plugins
